### Amazon Q Business application using Identity Federation through IAM Example

This repository provides a demonstration of how to use AWS CloudFormation automation to create a Q Business application with secure user authentication using IAM Identity Federation with Amazon Cognito. The repository is simplistic and does not aim to provide production-ready code but rather serves as an example from which readers can benefit when building automated solutions.

This CloudFormation template creates a basic infrastructure for a Q Business application using IAM Identity Federation with the following key resources fully automated: 
 - **Cognito User Pool**: Manages user accounts and authentication, acting as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider (IdP).
 - **Cognito Identity Pool**: Provides temporary AWS credentials for authenticated users defined in the User Pool.
 - **QBusiness Application**: Offers a generative AIâ€“powered assistant connected to an OIDC based identity provider.

Note: While the template code has been built with security in mind, you should still review all the policy definitions and resource configurations to ensure they suit your use case.
